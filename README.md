CircuitPython Synthio Tutorial
==============================

Welcome to a little CircuitPython Synthio Tutorial.

In CircuitPython, `synthio` is a built-in module for doing sound synthesis
on microcontrollers such as the Pico (RP2040/RP2350).

This tutorial assumes you know a bit of Python and CircuitPython already.
It doesn't try to assume you know much about synthesizers or [music theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0).

This tutorial is broken up into sections.

* [1. Getting Started](./README-Getting-Started.md)
-- Going from a fresh Pico to making boops and responding to inputs

* [2. Modulation](./README-Modulation.md)
-- Making those boops sound more alive with LFOs and Envelopes

* [3. Filters and Advanced Modulation](./README-Filters.md)
-- How to use synthio's filters and modulate them

* [4. Wavetables](./README-Wavetables.md)
-- Change a note's waveform, at any time

* [5. MIDI](./README-MIDI.md)
